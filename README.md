Walleye is a convenient platform that consolidates Costa Rica's public records into one easily accessible app.

With the ability to search by a person's identification number or full name, users can quickly and efficiently access people's information.

Currently, the supported information platforms are:

- Tribunal Supremo de Elecciones
- Ministerio de Hacienda
- Caja Costarricense Seguro Social
- Registro Nacional (At this time, [their website](https://rn.rnpdigital.com/) is currently undergoing maintenance)

This project is hosted on Vercel and is available [here](https://walleye.ealpizar.com/).
